- My program contains 3 classes, each in a separate java class file.Thus, each class had to be public so that they can be accessed from within the same package.
- A Board class exists, which serves as the model.
- A View class exists, which serves as the view to handle the user interface of the program.
- A Game class exists, which has the main function and a play method. It serves as the controller to link between Board and View.
- All classes are under a package called "tictactoe".
- When running the program, enter row & column values as instructed. Note that entries are 0-based.
